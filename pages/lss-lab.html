      Located in the South Engineering Research Center, the Large Scale Structures
      Lab (LSSL) is equipped to test high force seismic and wind response. The
      12-ft x 13-ft earthquake simulation shake table can withstand 20 tons and
      1.2g acceleration. The lab's floor contains reaction blocks that can be
      arranged in various configurations for diversified testing.
