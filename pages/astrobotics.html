location-description: Alabama Astrobotics is a robotics team that competes each year in NASA's Robotic Mining Competition at Kennedy Space Center. At the competition teams from around the country compete with their remote-controlled or autonomous robotic excavators in a super sized 12'x24' sandbox, which is filled with BP-1 regolith simulant, to see who can collect the most "moon dirt." Alabama Astrobotics is the only team with multiple victories and has won three times out of the seven years the competition has been held.
