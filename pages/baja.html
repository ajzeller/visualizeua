location-description:  Bama Racing is a student team dedicated to the design and fabrication of an off-road vehicle for competition in SAE sanctioned baja events against nearly 100 teams from across the country. The off-road vehicle tests in a series of challenges on rough terrain. These challenges gauge the vehicleâ€™s acceleration, maneuverability, suspension, traction, hill climb and endurance during a race. The first four events are timed trials on short tracks, while the final endurance race tests the number of laps the vehicle can complete in four hours.
