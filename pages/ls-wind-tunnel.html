location-description: Located in Hardaway Hall, the Low-Speed Wind Tunnel Lab contains a boundary layer tunnel and a closed-circuit wind tunnel. The open circuit boundary layer tunnel can be configured in a 16 foot long test section that can test speeds of 45 m/s or in a 6 foot long test section with speeds from 1 to 20 m/s. Built in the 1930s, the closed-circuit wind tunnel can operate at speeds up to 100 mph. Both tunnels are supplied with instrumentation tools including volumetric three-component velocimetry (V3V), multi-channel DAQ devices, and hot-wire anemometry.
